# cfml-zpl
<h2>A library for printing and interacting with ZPL data/labels using ColdFusion</h2>

Examples of how to use CFML and Java to print ZPL on label printers. Two examples are used:
<ol>
<li>To a computer connected printer</li>
<li>To a network IP printer</li>
</ol>

The code is a copy from a project which I worked on some time ago, therefore please excuse the use of tags.

<h3>How to use</h3>
You need to download the `zpl.cfc` and extract somewhere in your app. In the `index.cfm` file there is an example that shows how to 
use the component.
