# cfml-zpl
<h2>A library for printing and interacting with ZPL data/labels using ColdFusion</h2>

Examples of how to use CFML and Java to print ZPL on label printers. Two examples are used:
<ol>
<li>To a computer connected printer</li>
<li>To a network IP printer</li>
</ol>

The code is a copy from a project which I worked on some time ago. Therefore, please excuse the use of tags. It also needs some cleaning (contains extra code such as queries which were useful for that project). Feel free to branch and clean it up if you like.
